# I feel hollow inside

People love. Everyone I knew, they love who they love. That's how human life works.

With more love comes more resposibility. I don't feel love but damn, lot of pressure.

As a grown up I should've stop muttering about my feelings like a teenager and take resposibility. There are goals to achieve and a future to forge. But I'm just trying so hard to avoid everything I feel fall short of.

My job never done well, my mission never accomplished. Now I don't plan because the fearness came instantly. Thus no risk I could take.
